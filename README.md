# porfolio-v3

This personal portfolio showcases the programming projects I have completed to date, including links to the deployed applications and relevant GitHub repositories. The portfolio also includes some information about be, my contact information, and a link to my résumé.

The live application is deployed here: https://stevtm.github.io/portfolio-v3/

## Tools Used

The following tools, among others, were used in the development of this application:

- `React` for application building and logic
- `prop-types` for validation that props are being passed in the desired data format
- `React Icons` for popular icons to display in the application
- `react-responsive` to manage responsive rendering of different React components based on viewport size
- `styled-components` for application styling
